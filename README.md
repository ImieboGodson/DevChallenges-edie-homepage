## Overview

<!-- ![screenshot](https://github.com/ImieboGodson/DevChallenges-checkout-page/blob/master/resources/images/checkout-page%20desktop-view.png) -->


 This project took a while to complete more because of the occurrences around me while building, and also because I had to learn DOM (Document Object Model) Manipulation all over again. It was ultimately fun, learnt a ton of new stuff around DOM and its overall effect on web apps on a larger scale (Given that DOM is rebuilt from ground up everytime an interaction occurs on the page due to DOM Manipulation, your goal as a developer is to minimise the amount of DOM Manipulation that happens in your app...in comes React and the rest)

 As in the previous challenges, I decided to account for other screen sizes apart from the required mobile phone and desktop views.

You can checkout the [demo](https://edie-company.netlify.app/).
